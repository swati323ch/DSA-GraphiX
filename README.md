# DSAGraphiX

DSAGraphiX is an interactive  tool designed to visualize DSA in an engaging manner. This project aims to enhance understanding of fundamental DSA concepts by providing visual demonstrations. .DSAGraphiX allows users to input their own data, enabling of visualizations accordingly.

## Features

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** - Demonstrates the step-by-step process of comparing and swapping adjacent elements to sort a list.
- **Insertion Sort** - Illustrates how elements are inserted into their correct positions one at a time.

### Tree Traversals
The website provides visualizations of tree traversal techniques include:

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Inorder Traversal
- Preorder Traversal
- Postorder Traversal

### Graph Algorithms

DSAGraphiX supports visualization of graph algorithms for both directed and undirected graphs. These include:

- B-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for exploring graph structures.
- Topological Sort for directed acyclic graphs.
- Shortest Path Algorithms to determine the minimum distance between nodes.
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) construction for finding the smallest tree that connects all nodes.
